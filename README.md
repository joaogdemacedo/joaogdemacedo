👋 Hello! I'm João, a passionate software engineer with a keen interest in software energy consumption and WebAssembly. My journey has been marked by a drive to explore innovative solutions that bridge technology and sustainability.

📚 During my tenure at INESC TEC and the University of Minho, I delved deep into the realm of software energy consumption, leading the charge as the main author of three research papers in this field. This experience not only honed my research skills but also fueled my curiosity to explore the uncharted territories of technology.

🔍 My curiosity led me to the captivating world of WebAssembly and Rust, learning the ropes through open-source contributions. Check out my Blog to learn more about what I'm up to!
