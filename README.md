## Hi there <a href="https://www.gautamkrishnar.com/"><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="5%"></a>

My name is JoÃ£o GonÃ§alves De Macedo, I am 26 years old, and I am from Amares, Portugal ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¹ 

I have recently finished a Masterâ€™s Degree in Software Engineering at the [University of Minho](https://www.uminho.pt/EN). With my dissertation research, WebAssembly became my main interest. Thus, learning Rust is one of my main goals in order to be part of WebAssemblyâ€™s future. I am not an expert. However, one of the most important skills I have learned at University is to be self-taught.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently looking for my first job
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Rust
