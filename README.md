My name is João Gonçalves De Macedo, I am 26 years old, and I am from Amares, Portugal 🇵🇹

I have recently finished a Master’s Degree in Software Engineering at the [University of Minho](https://www.uminho.pt/EN). With my dissertation research, WebAssembly became my main interest. Thus, learning Rust is one of my main goals in order to be part of WebAssembly’s future. I am not an expert. However, one of the most important skills I have learned at University is to be self-taught.
